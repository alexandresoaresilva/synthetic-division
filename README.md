# synthetic-division

cute polynomial solver that uses synthetic division to find the polynomial's roots. Synthetic division was implemented with Newton's method.
 
This is an extended version of an engineering analysis assingment, which before only solved polynomials with integer and rational roots. Now, it solves polynomials of arbitrary degree with real or complex roots.
