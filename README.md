# synthetic-division

Polynomial solver that uses synthetic division implemented with Newton's method to find roots. 
 
This is an extended version of an engineering analysis assingment, which before only solved polynomials with integer and rational roots. 

Now, it solves polynomials of arbitrary degree with real or complex roots.
